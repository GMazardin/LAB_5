---------------------------Part 1 Questions------------------------------
1.
    This code tracks an inventory during a few days. Each day, according
    to a few parameters, the quality of each item in the inventory will
    be updated. The program runs 30 days.
   
2.
    The goods in the Guilded Rose are easily identifiable, however the 
    display is really messy. There are so many days that follow 
    themselves and they are all put together on a vertical alignment.
    Still, we can find each item description in the "Program.cs" file,
    because they are all created inside the main loop. This way, we can
    clearly identify all items' names.

3.
    When the day is over, all of the items' qualities are updated following
    some rules declared in the "GuildedRose.cs" class/file. Also, the program
    sets a blank space so that the current day will have space between it and
    the next day.
    
4.
    At the end of each day, the quality of the cheese increases by 2. Why ? 
    Because the cheese gets better and better with time according to the rules
    said in the document.

5.
    When a concert ticket goes over its expiration day, its quality goes to 0,
    because the concert already passed, so it has no value anymore.
    
6.
    This code is hard to read because it has no comments. Most of the information
    I gathered was coming from the french explanation of the code. 
    Also, the display of each day in the run is very hard to read because all of 
    the days are done at the same time and we can't see many of them clearly.
    Finally, there is too much code in the main program and it should be better
    separated into multiple files.

7.
    Yes, I think the rules are clear enough to make a new solution from scratch,
    thanks to the french documentation online that explains what the code does
    when running.
